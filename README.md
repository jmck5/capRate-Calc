# capRate-Calc
NB: This project is not yet complete and values returned are currently INCORRECT.
This is a calculator to calculate the required annual amount to recover an asset that will depreciate to zero over a known time frame.
The calculator considers the opportunity cost of the investment (as an alternative interest rate), the initial outlay and the time frame.
Note that the calculator does not yet account for interest on returned money, therefore currently the calculator returns an incorrect value.

Made in Visual Studio, mostly drag and drop using Windows Forms.
